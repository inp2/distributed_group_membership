# Distributed Log Querier

## Introduction

A company just discovered that distributed systems are hard to debug. We
must build a solution that they can use. They want a system that is fast
and correct.

## Motivation

Debuggers work well mostly in single-threaded programs. The most popular
apporach to debugging distributed systems is logging. This means that
each  machine creates one or more local files into which are accumulated
status messages, error messages, and in general anything that you want
to log. These logs can then be queried remotely.

Any code that we write will have bugs. The industry standard for making
sure that your program accomplishes what you desire, is unit testing.
